## üöß Development Setup
### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following tools and environments set up on your machine:
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Docker (optional)
### ‚≠ê Local Development Setup
#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```
#### 2. Configure Application Settings
Update the configuration files located at `PRN231.API/appsettings.json` and `PRN231.API/appsettings.Development.json` with appropriate database connection strings, Redis configurations, and other settings.
#### 3. Restore Dependencies
At the root directory, restore the required NuGet packages by running:
```bash
dotnet restore
```
#### 4. Run the Application
Launch the application locally using the following command:
```bash
dotnet run --project PRN231.API
```

__üöÄ The application will listen on:__
- HTTP: **http://localhost:5184**
- HTTPS: **https://localhost:7100**

(You can change these ports in the launchSettings.json file located at PRN231.API/Properties/launchSettings.json)
### üê≥ Dockerized Development Setup (Optional)
#### 1. Configure Application Settings
Update the same configuration files (`PRN231.API/appsettings.json` and `PRN231.API/appsettings.Development.json`) with appropriate database connection strings, Redis configurations, and other settings.
#### 2. Build and Run Docker Containers
At the project root directory, use Docker Compose to build and run the containers:
```bash
docker compose up
```
